## About

Sentinel is a comprehensive framework designed to simplify the development, deployment, and management of autonomous agents on blockchain networks. By providing a robust set of tools and abstractions, Sentinel empowers developers to create intelligent agents that can interact with blockchain protocols, execute transactions, monitor events, and respond to on-chain activities.

### Key Features ✨

- **🔗 Multi-chain Support** - Deploy agents across various blockchain networks
- **🤖 Agent Orchestration** - Coordinate multiple agents with advanced workflow management
- **📊 Monitoring & Analytics** - Real-time insights into agent performance and blockchain activity
- **🛠️ Developer-friendly APIs** - Intuitive interfaces for building complex agent logic
- **🔒 Security-focused** - Built-in safeguards and permission systems for secure agent operations
- **📝 Smart Contract Integration** - Seamless interaction with existing smart contracts

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- NPM or Yarn
- Basic understanding of blockchain concepts

### Installation

```bash
# Using npm
npm install @sentinel/core

# Using yarn
yarn add @sentinel/core
```

### Quick Start

```javascript
import { Agent, Networks } from '@sentinel/core';

// Create a new agent
const myAgent = new Agent({
  name: 'TransactionMonitor',
  network: Networks.ETHEREUM,
  privateKey: process.env.PRIVATE_KEY // Use environment variables for sensitive data
});

// Define agent behavior
myAgent.on('NewBlock', async (blockData) => {
  console.log(`New block detected: ${blockData.number}`);
  
  // Check for specific transactions
  const targetTxs = blockData.transactions.filter(tx => 
    tx.to === '0xYourTargetAddress'
  );
  
  if (targetTxs.length > 0) {
    await myAgent.sendNotification({
      channel: 'slack',
      message: `Found ${targetTxs.length} relevant transactions!`
    });
  }
});

// Start the agent
myAgent.start();
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

Sentinel is built with a modular architecture that allows for flexibility and extensibility:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│         Sentinel Core           │
├─────────────┬───────────────────┤
│ Agent Layer │ Blockchain Layer  │
├─────────────┼───────────────────┤
│ Event System│ Transaction Layer │
├─────────────┴───────────────────┤
│        Integration Layer        │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🔧 Use Cases

- **DeFi Monitoring**: Track liquidity pools, yield farming opportunities, and arbitrage possibilities
- **NFT Trading Bots**: Automate purchases based on floor price and rarity metrics
- **DAO Governance**: Participate in governance votes based on predetermined criteria
- **Supply Chain Tracking**: Monitor and verify on-chain supply chain events
- **Cross-chain Bridges**: Automate asset transfers between different blockchain networks
